TODO:
-Add EasyCCG to the pipeline (Try to find out why not all CCG parses translated )
-Add more information to CCG parses in EasyCCG, and run experiments again. Probably Pair 1 will break
-Missing case in Alchemy 
-After addtion more info to EasyCCG, more errors occure
1: revise the handling of EQ
12-14: ??
15: ??
22-24: exception 
25: ??
30: one of X
=====================
DONE:
-polish scripts and datasets
-when negating T to calculate P(notT|H), and T has multible sentneces, and there is a corefernece resolution between these 
sentences, scope of quantifiers get missed up. Check Pair 12.
-Complete implmenetation of correference resoltion 
-SetGoalPTP: change code of withExistence withFixUnivInQ withFixCWA to avoid generation of constants also, not only removing the rules.
-SetGoalPTP: Find code that works for both FraCas and Syn
-Revise AutoTyping and add comments

1-11: correct
12-15: (all wrong and all timeout)
16-21: correct
22-25: correct (25 is a bit slow. parses are correct)
26-31: correct
32-34: correct(wrong parses in H )
35: withNegT timesout (parse wrong in T)
36-39: correct
40-42: correct(wrong parses in T)
43: withNegT timesout (parse wrong in T)(gold standard is wrong. Worng GS: Entail, Correct GS: Neutral)
44-46: correct


TODO: 
-Fix parse of 35,43. Fixing parse will get rid of the timeout  (stupid, fokkak menha)
-Fix propagation for 12-15 
-Run fixed propagation on 22-25
-Fix parse parses in H for 32-34,40-42 to make sure you are on the right track (not 100% important)
-15 and 25 have more than one connection between LHS and RHS


correct: 1-11,16-21,26-31,36-39,44-46
timouets: 12-15,22-25,32-35,40-43



24: correct
16: timeout and more
6: misparse

IT IS BETTER TO RERUN FRACAS WITH POS, CHUNK AND NER

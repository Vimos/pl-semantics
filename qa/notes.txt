-Update scala code to keep track of entities
-So far, universal and negations are ignored
-What is going to happen to universally quntified variables in the query ? expect a problem (try: bin/mlnsem  run  sick-rte 1  -log TRACE -negativeEvd false  -softLogic mln  -withNegT true)
-Ideally, I should run the theorem prover before parsing (alchemy parsing changes Exist with disjunction)
-I am not using it for RTE. To use it with Query Formula, the FOL program should be parsed first without the query. That is a lot of coding
-Given MLN: c = {Const1}, R = {forall x man(x)} does not work. Parsing of E's output is wrong in case output is universally quantifid
-Given MLN: c = {Const1}, R = {forall x man(x) v drive(x)}. Marginal prob != prior probability, but nothing is inferrable
-Try to infer just the query, then find the ground atom from the proof tree
-if I have two contradictory rules (even if they are weighted), things do not work nicely because the weighted rules are treated as hard rules when passed to the theorem prover
-Run condor QA jobs in groups (DONE)
-Fix broken condor QA runs
-Boxer takese forever sometimes
-Stackoverflow in HardAssumption.

MLN: 
-variable names: replacing x, s, p with 100, 200, 300 means it will break for large docs
-pass NE, POS, Coref to Candc
-use softLogic mln not ss

---
-find the entity whose surrounding context is similar to the query 

Note about coref: 
The entity could be named differently in the Q and the Context. A coref is needed in the Context document, then accept the answer if the expected entity name is one of the possible names of the selected entity. 
Expected problem: it is easy to cheat here by setting all entities in the context document to be corefering and all of them get the same name. This is a valid critisizm to the method mentioned above. 

Datasets: 

Mike Lewis: Relations, single distributional rule between lexical items

My constructs: Like Mike Lewis unless I make the sentences more complex

MC-Test: answers are not named entities. In many cases it is a sentence. Some questions are Why ? When ? How long ? How ? non-NPs as answers of what, e.g. 
1: multiple: What kind of exercises did Sophie do?
 A) Jumping jacks and running.
 B) Stretching when she got out of bed.
 C) Sophie didn't exercise because she didn't have time.
 D) Sitting in front of her television and playing games.
"What" questions are 1416/2640, 538 named entities and the rest are long sentences.  

Facebook: The 20 tasks are not about linguistic reasoning. 
SimpleQuestions: Questions querying freebase entries, where a query is a rephrasing of relation(entity, X), where the type of X sometimes is given in the question.  

DeepMind: Looks good for us. We are going to need weird

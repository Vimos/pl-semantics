Jerusalem ## SubjFoundObjFound

Jerusalem ( ; ; ) , located on a plateau in the Judean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea , is one of the oldest cities in the world . It is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions ‚ Ä î Judaism , Christianity and Islam . Israelis and Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital , as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power ; however , neither claim is widely recognized internationally . During its long history , Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice , besieged 23 times , attacked 52 times , and captured and recaptured 44 times . The oldest part of the city was settled in the 4th millennium BCE . In 1538 , walls were built around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent . Today those walls define the Old City , which has been traditionally divided into four quarters ‚ Ä î known since the early 19th century as the Armenian , Christian , Jewish , and Muslim Quarters . The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981 , and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger . Modern Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City 's boundaries . According to the Biblical tradition , King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel , and his son , King Solomon , commissioned the building of the First Temple . These foundational events , straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE , assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people . The sobriquet of holy city ( " ◊ ¢ ◊ ô ◊ ® ◊ î ◊ ß ◊ ï ◊ ì ◊ © " , transliterated " ‚ Ä ò ir haqodesh " ) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times . The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity , conserved in the Septuagint which Christians adopted as their own authority , was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus 's crucifixion there . In Sunni Islam , Jerusalem is the third-holiest city , after Mecca and Medina . In Islamic tradition in 610 CE it became the first Qibla , the focal point for Muslim prayer ( salat ) , and Muhammad made his Night Journey there ten years later , ascending to heaven where he speaks to God , according to the Quran . As a result , despite having an area of only , the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance , among them the Temple Mount and its Western Wall , the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , the Dome of the Rock , the Garden Tomb and al-Aqsa Mosque . Today , the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli ‚ Ä ì Palestinian conflict . During the 1948 Arab ‚ Ä ì Israeli War , West Jerusalem was among the areas captured and later annexed by Israel while East Jerusalem , including the Old City , was captured and later annexed by Jordan . Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it . Israel 's 1980 Basic Law the Jerusalem Law refers to Jerusalem as the country 's undivided capital and all branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem , including the Knesset ( Israel 's parliament ) , the residences of the Prime Minister and President , and the Supreme Court . The international community rejected the annexation as illegal and treats East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel . The international community does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel 's capital , and the city hosts no foreign embassies . Jerusalem is home to the Hebrew University and to the Israel Museum with its Shrine of the Book . In 2011 , Jerusalem had a population of 801,000 , of which Jews comprised 497,000 ( 62 % ) , Muslims 281,000 ( 35 % ) , Christians 14,000 ( around 2 % ) and 9,000 ( 1 % ) were not classified by religion . A city called " Ru ≈ ° alim " in the Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt ( c. 19th century BCE ) is widely , but not universally , identified as Jerusalem . Jerusalem is called " Uru ≈ ° alim " in the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba ( 1330s BCE ) . The name " Jerusalem " is variously etymologized to mean " foundation ( Sumerian " yeru " , 'settlement'/Semitic " yry " ' 'to found , to lay a cornerstone ' ) of the god Shalem " , the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city . The form " Yerushalem " or " Yerushalayim " ( Jerusalem ) first appears in the Bible , in the Book of Joshua . According to a Midrash , the name is a combination of " Yhwh Yir'eh " ( " God will see to it " , the name given by Abraham to the place where he began to sacrifice his son ) and the town " Shalem " . The earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961 . The inscription states : " I am Yahweh thy God , I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem " , or as other scholars suggest : " Yahweh is the God of the whole earth . The mountains of Judah belong to him , to the God of Jerusalem " . Shalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion , whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for " peace " is derived ( Salam or Shalom in modern Arabic and Hebrew ) . The name thus offered itself to etymologizations such as " The City of Peace " , " Abode of Peace " , " dwelling of peace " ( " founded in safety " ) , alternately " Vision of Peace " in some Christian authors . The ending " -ayim " indicates the dual , thus leading to the suggestion that the name " Yerushalayim " refers to the fact that the city sits on two hills . However , the pronunciation of the last syllable as " -ayim " appears to be a late development , which had not yet appeared at the time of the Septuagint . The most ancient settlement of Jerusalem , founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring , was according to the Bible named Jebus ( " e.g . " , Judges 19 : 10 : ◊ ô ÷ ∞ ◊ ë ◊ ï ÷ º ◊ ° , ◊ î ÷ ¥ ◊ ô ◊ ê ◊ ô ÷ ∞ ◊ ® ◊ ï ÷ º ◊ © ÷ ∏ ◊ Å ◊ ú ÷ ¥ ÷ ∏ : " Jebus , it [ is ] Jerusalem " ) . Called the " Fortress of Zion " ( " metsudat Zion " ) , it was renamed by David as the City of David , and was known by this name in antiquity . Another name , " Zion " , initially referred to a distinct part of the city , but later came to signify the city as a whole and to represent the biblical Land of Israel . In Greek and Latin the city 's name was transliterated " Hierosolyma " ( Greek : · º π Œ µ œ Å Œ ø œ É œ å Œ ª œ Ö Œ º Œ ± ; in Greek " hier √ ≤ s " , " · º ± Œ µ œ Å œ å œ Ç " , means holy ) , although the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina for part of the Roman period of its history . The Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls ( 1QapGen 22 : 13 ) equates Jerusalem with the earlier " Salem " ( ◊ © ◊ ú ◊ ù ) , said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14 : 18 . Other early Hebrew sources , early Christian renderings of the verse and " targumim " , however , put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem ( or Sichem ) , now Nablus , a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing . Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem , which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans . However that may be , later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem , mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions . In Arabic , Jerusalem is most commonly known as , transliterated as " al-Quds " and meaning " The Holy " or " The Holy Sanctuary " . Official Israeli government policy mandates that , transliterated as " ≈ ™ r ≈ ° al ƒ ´ m " , which is the cognate of the Hebrew and English names , be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with . . Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called " " Qudsi " or " Maqdisi " " , while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym . Given the city 's central position in both Jewish nationalism ( Zionism ) and Palestinian nationalism , the selectivity required to summarize more than 5,000 years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or background ( see Historiography and nationalism ) . The periods of Jewish sovereignty in the city 's history are important to Israeli nationalists ( Zionists ) , who claim the right to the city based on Jewish descent from the Israelite Kingdom of Judah , of which Jerusalem was the capital . The periods of Islamic , Christian and other non-Jewish periods of the city 's history are important to Palestinian nationalists , who claim the right to the city based on modern Palestinians ' descent from many different peoples who have lived in the region . As a result , both sides claim the history of the city has been politicized by the other in order to strengthen their relative claims to the city , and that this is borne out by the different focuses the different writers place on the various events and eras in the city 's history . Ceramic evidence indicates occupation of the City of David , within present-day Jerusalem , as far back as the Copper Age ( c. 4th millennium BCE ) , with evidence of a permanent settlement during the early Bronze Age ( c. 3000 ‚ Ä ì 2800 BCE ) . The Execration Texts ( c. ¬ † 19th century BCE ) , which refer to a city called " rw ≈ ° 3lmm , " variously transcribed as " Ru ≈ ° alimum " / " Uru ≈ ° alimum " / " R √ ¥ sh-ramen " and the Amarna letters ( c. ¬ † 14th century BCE ) may be the earliest mention of the city . Some archaeologists , including Kathleen Kenyon , believe Jerusalem was founded by Northwest Semitic people with organized settlements from around 2600 BCE . Nadav Na'aman argues its fortification as the centre of a kingdom dates to around the 18th century BCE . The first settlement lay on the Ophel ridge . In the late Bronze Age , Jerusalem was the capital of an Egyptian vassal city-state , a modest settlement governing a few outlying villages and pastoral areas , with a small Egyptian garrison and ruled by appointees such as king Abdi-Heba , At the time of Seti I and Ramesses II , major construction took place as prosperity increased . This period , when Canaan formed part of the Egyptian empire corresponds in biblical accounts to Joshua ‚ Ä ô s invasion . In the Bible , Jerusalem is defined as lying within territory allocated to the tribe of Benjamin though occupied by Jebusites . David is said to have conquered these in the Siege of Jebus , and transferred his capital from Hebron to Jerusalem which then became the capital of a united Kingdom of Israel , and one of its several religious centres . The choice was perhaps dictated by the fact that Jerusalem did not form part of Israel ‚ Ä ô s tribal system , and was thus suited to serve as the centre of its federation . Opinion is divided over whether a Large Stone Structure and a nearby Stepped Stone Structure may be identified with King David 's palace , or dates to a later period . According to the Bible , King David reigned for 40 years . The generally accepted estimate of the conclusion of this reign is 970 BCE . The Bible states that David was succeeded by his son Solomon , who built the Holy Temple on Mount Moriah . Solomon 's Temple ( later known as the " First Temple " ) , went on to play a pivotal role in Jewish history as the repository of the Ark of the Covenant . On Solomon 's death , ten of the northern Tribes of Israel broke with the United Monarchy to form their own nations , kings , prophets , priests , traditions relating to religion , capitals and temples in northern Israel . The southern tribes , together with the Aaronid priesthood , remained in Jerusalem , with the city becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Judah . Archeological remains from the ancient Israelite period also include Siloam Tunnel , an aqueduct built by Judean king Hezekiah and decorated with ancient Hebrew inscription , known as Siloam Inscription , Broad Wall a defensive fortification built in the 8th century BCE , also by Hezekiah , Monolith of Silwan , Tomb of the Royal Steward , which were decorated with monumental Hebrew inscriptions , and Israelite Tower , remnants of ancient fortifications , built from large , sturdy rocks with carved cornerstones . A huge water reservoir dating from this period was discovered in 2012 near Robinson 's Arch , indicating the existence of a densely built-up quarter across the area west of the Temple Mount during the Judean kingdom . When the Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE , Jerusalem was strengthened by a great influx of refugees from the northern kingdom . The First Temple period ended around 586 BCE , as the Babylonians conquered Judah and Jerusalem , and laid waste to Solomon 's Temple . In 538 BCE , the Persian King Cyrus the Great invited the Jews of Babylon to return to Judah to rebuild the Temple . Construction of the Second Temple was completed in 516 BCE , during the reign of Darius the Great , 70 years after the destruction of the First Temple . In about 445 BCE , King Artaxerxes I of Persia issued a decree allowing the city ( including its walls ) to be rebuilt . Jerusalem resumed its role as capital of Judah and center of Jewish worship . Many Jewish tombs from the Second Temple period have been rediscovered in Jerusalem . One example , discovered north of the Old City , contains human remains in an ossuary decorated with the Aramaic inscription " Simon the Temple Builder . " The Tomb of Abba , also located north of the Old City , bears an Aramaic inscription with Paleo-Hebrew letters reading : " I , Abba , son of the priest Eleaz ( ar ) , son of Aaron the high ( priest ) , Abba , the oppressed and the persecuted , who was born in Jerusalem , and went into exile into Babylonia and brought ( back to Jerusalem ) Mattathi ( ah ) , son of Jud ( ah ) , and buried him in a cave which I bought by deed " The Tomb of Benei Hezir located in Kidron Valley is decorated by monumental Doric columns and Hebrew inscription , identifying it as the burial site of Second Temple priests . The Tombs of the Sanhedrin , an underground complex of 63 rock-cut tombs , is located in a public park in the northern Jerusalem neighborhood of Sanhedria . These tombs , probably reserved for members of the Sanhedrin and inscribed by ancient Hebrew and Aramaic writings , are dated to between 100 BCE and 100 CE . When Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire , Jerusalem and Judea came under Macedonian control , eventually falling to the Ptolemaic dynasty under Ptolemy I . In 198 BCE , Ptolemy V Epiphanes lost Jerusalem and Judea to the Seleucids under Antiochus III . The Seleucid attempt to recast Jerusalem as a Hellenized city-state came to a head in 168 BCE with the successful Maccabean revolt of Mattathias and his five sons against Antiochus IV Epiphanes , and their establishment of the Hasmonean Kingdom in 152 BCE with Jerusalem as its capital . In 63 BCE , Pompey the Great intervened in a struggle for the Hasmonean throne and captured Jerusalem , extending the influence of the Roman Republic over Judea . Following a short invasion by Parthians , backing the rival Hasmonean rulers , Judea became a scene of struggle between pro-Roman and pro-Parthian forces , eventually leading to the emergence of an Edomite named Herod . As Rome became stronger , it installed Herod as a Jewish client king . Herod the Great , as he was known , devoted himself to developing and beautifying the city . He built walls , towers and palaces , and expanded the Temple Mount , buttressing the courtyard with blocks of stone weighing up to 100 tons . Under Herod , the area of the Temple Mount doubled in size . Shortly after Herod 's death , in 6 CE Judea came under direct Roman rule as the Iudaea Province , although the Herodian dynasty through Agrippa II remained client kings of neighbouring territories until 96 CE . Roman rule over Jerusalem and the region was challenged in the First Jewish ‚ Ä ì Roman War , which ended with a Roman victory . The Second Temple was destroyed in 70 CE , and the entire city was destroyed in the war . The contemporary Jewish historian Josephus wrote that the city " was so thoroughly razed to the ground by those that demolished it to its foundations , that nothing was left that could ever persuade visitors that it had once been a place of habitation . " Roman rule was again challenged during the Bar Kokhba revolt , beginning in 132 CE and suppressed by the Romans in 135 CE . Following the Bar Kokhba revolt , Emperor Hadrian combined Iudaea Province with neighboring provinces under the new name of " Syria Palaestina " , replacing the name of Judea . The city was renamed Aelia Capitolina , and rebuilt it in the style of a typical Roman town . Jews were prohibited from entering the city on pain of death , except for one day each year , during the holiday of Tisha B'Av . Taken together , these measures ( which also affected Jewish Christians ) essentially " secularized " the city . The ban was maintained until the 7th century , though Christians would soon be granted an exemption : during the 4th century , the Roman Emperor Constantine I ordered the construction of Christian holy sites in the city , including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . Burial remains from the Byzantine period are exclusively Christian , suggesting that the population of Jerusalem in Byzantine times probably consisted only of Christians . In the 5th century , the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire , ruled from the recently renamed Constantinople , maintained control of the city . Within the span of a few decades , Jerusalem shifted from Byzantine to Persian rule , then back to Roman-Byzantine dominion . Following Sassanid Khosrau II 's early 7th century push through Syria , his generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin attacked Jerusalem ( ) aided by the Jews of Palaestina Prima , who had risen up against the Byzantines . In the Siege of Jerusalem of 614 , after 21 days of relentless siege warfare , Jerusalem was captured . Byzantine chronicles relate that the Sassanids and Jews slaughtered tens of thousands of Christians in the city , many at the Mamilla Pool , and destroyed their monuments and churches , including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . This episode has been the subject of much debate between historians . The conquered city would remain in Sassanid hands for some fifteen years until the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius reconquered it in 629 . Jerusalem reached a peak in size and population at the end of the Second Temple Period , when the city covered two square kilometers ( ) and had a population of 200,000 . Byzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab armies of Umar ibn al-Khattab in 638 CE . Among Muslims of Islam 's earliest era it was referred to as " Madinat bayt al-Maqdis " ( " City of the Temple " ) which was restricted to the Temple Mount . The rest of the city " ... ¬ † was called Iliya , reflecting the Roman name given the city following the destruction of 70 CE : " Aelia Capitolina " " . Later the Temple Mount became known as " al-Haram al-Sharif " , ‚ Ä ú The Noble Sanctuary " , while the city around it became known as " Bayt al-Maqdis " , and later still , " al-Quds al-Sharif " " The Noble City " . The Islamization of Jerusalem began in the first year A.H. ( 623 CE ) , when Muslims were instructed to face the city while performing their daily prostrations and , according to Muslim religious tradition , Muhammad 's night journey and ascension to heaven took place . After 13 years , the direction of prayer was changed to Mecca . In 638 CE the Islamic Caliphate extended its dominion to Jerusalem . With the Arab conquest , Jews were allowed back into the city . The Rashidun caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab signed a treaty with Monophysite Christian Patriarch Sophronius , assuring him that Jerusalem 's Christian holy places and population would be protected under Muslim rule . Christian-Arab tradition records that , when led to pray at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , the holiest site for Christians , the caliph Umar refused to pray in the church so that Muslims would not request conversion of the church to a mosque . He prayed outside the church , where the Mosque of Umar ( Omar ) stands to this day , opposite the entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . According to the Gaullic bishop Arculf , who lived in Jerusalem from 679 to 688 , the Mosque of Umar was a rectangular wooden structure built over ruins which could accommodate 3,000 worshipers . When the Muslims went to " Bayt Al-Maqdes " for the first time , they searched for the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque ( " The Farthest Mosque " ) that was mentioned in Quran and Hadith according to Islamic beliefs . Contemporary Arabic and Hebrew sources say the site was full of rubbish , and that Arabs and Jews cleaned it . The Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik commissioned the construction of the Dome of the Rock in the late 7th century . The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi writes that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with Jerusalem 's monumental churches . Over the next four hundred years Jerusalem 's prominence diminished as Arab powers in the region jockeyed for control . A messianic Karaite movement to gather in Jerusalem took place at the turn of the millennium , leading to a " Golden Age " of Karaite scholarship there , which was only terminated by the Crusades . Jerusalem was captured in 1073 by the Seljukid commander Ats ƒ ± z. < /small > Government Culture Education Maps Religion

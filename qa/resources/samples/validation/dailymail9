they were a species of early human thought to have roamed @entity3 and @entity4 for up to 300,000 years before finally dying out . now scientists believe they have ruled out one of the major theories for what triggered the extinction of the @entity10 . they have found that an enormous volcanic eruption in @entity12 40,000 years ago had little impact on the species ' demise . neanderthals , shown above from the tv series walking with @entity10 , were already on the decline by the time of the @entity21 eruption in @entity12 40,000 years ago caused widespread climate cooling although the @entity21 eruption was one of the largest volcanic explosions in @entity3 , scientists say the cooling and increased levels of acid rain that resulted from the explosive eruption would have had little impact in the areas where @entity10 were living . they argue that @entity10 populations had already started to decline by the time the volcano erupted and it was insufficient to trigger their extinction . neanderthals may have created and worn the world 's first jewellery 130,000 years ago , according to scientists . researchers examining eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at @entity44 in @entity45 say they were used to create necklace or bracelet . the claws bear multiple cut marks , notches and signs that they had been polishing by the @entity10 that once inhabited the site where they were found . anthropologists at the @entity55 say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in @entity3 . the findings add to mounting evidence that @entity10 were not the slow - witted and primitive creatures they are often portrayed as . instead they say that it was likely to be competition with modern humans that led to the demise of the @entity10 . dr @entity68 , from the department of earth sciences at the @entity71 , who led the research , said : ' radiocarbon dating has shown that at the time of the @entity21 eruption , anatomically modern humans had already arrived in @entity3 , and the range of @entity10 had steadily diminished . ' work at five sites in the @entity81 indicates that anatomically modern humans were established in these locations by then as well . ' anthropologists have for decades debated the possible causes for the extinction of @entity10 around 40,000 years ago . the species first appeared around 400,000 years ago and spread throughout much of @entity3 and @entity4 . some scientists have suggested that the species were killed off by modern humans - @entity90 - as they moved out of @entity92 or were unable to cope changes to the climate . however , others have proposed that the explosive eruption of a volcano close to what is now modern day @entity96 threw millions of tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that could have led to the final extinction of the @entity10 . recent research by scientists at the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 has helped support this view . this image shows the average temperature anomalies in excess of 3 Â° c in the year following the @entity21 eruption alongside sites where @entity10 and human remains from the time have been found @entity118 , which is part of the @entity121 super volcano , still overshadows the city of @entity96 ( above ) the huge crater left by this super-volcano , known as @entity121 , can still be seen on the coastline of @entity12 on the opposite side of @entity96 to @entity118 . however , dr @entity68 and his colleagues , whose work is published in the journal @entity131 , used computer modelling to simulate the impact this enormous eruption would have had on the area at the time . more than 150 cubic kilometers of magma was thrown out by the eruption . the sulphur dioxide would have acted like an aerosol , blanketing the area with a layer in the atmosphere that reflected sunlight back into space . they were big , brutish and probably not particularly good - looking . now it seems that @entity10 had to contend with an ailment that affected their appearance too - psoriasis . genetic research on @entity10 remains has shown that these now extinct ancient cousins of modern humans may have suffered from psoriasis . the research has also revealed that they may have suffered from other modern medical disorders such as @entity162 's disease , a condition that affects the digestive system . neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning @entity3 now have roughly two per cent @entity10 dna . these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history . however , some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases . scientists have found that part of our @entity183 system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from @entity10 . other researchers have suggested that humans outside @entity92 are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with @entity10 . researchers from @entity192 and @entity193 universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the neanderthal genome . a gene that can cause diabetes in @entity200 is also thought to have come from @entity10 , long before their ancestors colonised the @entity202 . the @entity121 caldera close to @entity204 , @entity12 hides a supervolcano that erupted around 40,000 years ago the researchers found that the largest temperature decreases would have occurred in eastern @entity3 and @entity4 , avoiding the areas where the last @entity10 populations were surviving in western @entity3 . they say that the eruption was ' probably insufficient ' to trigger the @entity10 extinction . however , they say that the cold weather that followed the eruption would still have impacted the day - to day life of @entity10 and early humans in @entity3 . they estimate that temperatures in western @entity3 fell by an average of two to four degrees c in the year following the eruption . dr @entity68 and his colleagues said : ' significant volcanic cooling during the years immediately following the eruption could have impacted the viability of already precarious populations and influenced many aspects of daily life for @entity10 and anatomically modern humans . '

they found the eruption in @entity12 cooled @placeholder 's climate by 2 - 4 degrees c

\abstract*{
  First-order logic provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for
  representing natural language semantics.  However, it is an open
  question of how best to integrate it with uncertain, probabilistic
  knowledge, for example regarding word meaning. This paper describes
  the first steps of an approach to recasting first-order semantics
  into the probabilistic models that are part of Statistical
  Relational AI.  Specifically, we show how Discourse Representation
  Structures can be combined with distributional models for word
  meaning inside a Markov Logic Network and used to successfully
  perform inferences that take advantage of logical concepts such as
  factivity as well as probabilistic information on word meaning in
  context.}

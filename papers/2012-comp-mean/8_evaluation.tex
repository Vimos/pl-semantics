\section{Evaluation}

As a preliminary evaluation of our system, we constructed a set of demonstrative
examples to test our ability to handle the previously discussed phenomena and
their interactions and ran each example with both a theorem prover and Alchemy. 
Note that when running an example in the theorem prover, weights are not
possible, so any rule that would be weighted in an MLN is simply treated as a
``hard clause'' following \citet{bos:emnlp2005}.
% We executed every example discussed in this paper and more.
